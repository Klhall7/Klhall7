<h1 align="center">Hola 👋, I'm Kyra!</h1>
<h3 align="center">A new developer, recently graduated from Carolina Code School in Greenville SC. Looking to keep coding and learning new skills as it is a major career transition for me. I like building user-friendly tools that make daily tasks and processes easier.</h3>

- 👨‍💻 I currently work a part-time remote position re-designing a company webpage for a small business in NY using WordPress. Outside of that, I take a few days out of the week to job search, and utlize online resources like ShiftNudge, SkillSoft, and The Odin Project to continue learning.

-  I am  **Open to Work**. Seeking an an entry-level role that will allow me to grow professionally. I am flexible on location, schedule, and duration. Please reach out if you have an oppotunity or any advice.
  
- 🤝 I’m looking add to my **Developer Portfolio**. Please reach out if you have any small projects you'd like to collaborate on, need some debugging assistance, or you'd like feedback on your own code. I'd love to get more practice in and help you meet your goals.

- 🚧  My largest personal project to date is [Actualize](https://actualize-k.netlify.app/). I would like to continue to refine it and am open to ideas. Feel free to look at the [source code](https://github.com/Klhall7/actualize-full-stack) and let me know if you have any feedback. 

- 🌱 I’m learning the basics of **Cloud Service Integration (Google, AWS, Azure). Enzyme & Jest (for unit testing)** so I can start integrating them into my projects.
  
- 💬 **Ask me about anything!** - One of my projects, the reasoning behind my code structure, whatever coding questions or feedback you'd like.<br/> You can email me @**kyravitch98@gmail.com** or request to connect on linkedIn...just make sure you leave a message explaining why you wan't to connect.
